# Lutris Gamepad UI

A simple, TV-friendly, gamepad-navigable frontend for the [Lutris](https://lutris.net/) game launcher on Linux. This application provides a "10-foot UI" designed for couch gaming, allowing you to browse and launch your Lutris library entirely with a gamepad.

[View Screenshots](./README_SCREENSHOTS.md)

## Requirements

-   A Linux-based operating system.
-   [Lutris](https://lutris.net/downloads) installed and configured with your games.
-   For full functionality, a standard desktop environment with **PulseAudio** (for audio control) and **BlueZ** (for Bluetooth management) is recommended.

## Installation

### AppImage (Recommended)

You can download the latest `.AppImage` from the [**Releases page**](https://github.com/andrew-ld/lutris-gamepad-ui/releases).

After downloading, make the file executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x lutris-gamepad-ui-*.AppImage
./lutris-gamepad-ui-*.AppImage
```

### Arch User Repository (AUR)

Arch Linux users (and users of Arch-based distributions) can install [`lutris-gamepad-ui-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lutris-gamepad-ui-git) from the AUR.

## Features

-   **Gamepad-First Interface:** Navigate the entire application without a mouse or keyboard. The UI provides context-aware on-screen button prompts that adapt to your connected controller (Xbox, PlayStation, etc.) and offers audio feedback for interactions.

-   **Organized Game Library:** Games are automatically organized into shelves for "Recently Played," "All Games," and by categories defined in Lutris. Game cards display cover art, playtime, and last played date, with dynamically generated gradients as fallbacks for missing art.

-   **Seamless Gameplay:** Launch games directly from the library. While a game is running, a clean "Now Playing" screen is displayed. A global shortcut (Gamepad Home/Guide button or `Ctrl+X`) allows you to toggle the UI's visibility without closing your game.

-   **Integrated System Controls:** Access a comprehensive system menu to manage your device. This includes a universal library search, audio output and volume controls, Bluetooth device management, and system power options (reboot, shutdown).

## Custom Theming Guide

You can customize the application's appearance by creating a `theme.json` file to override default CSS properties.

#### How It Works
On first launch, the application creates two files in its configuration directory:
-   `theme.default.json`: A reference file containing all available CSS selectors and their default properties. **Do not edit this file**, as it may be overwritten by updates.
-   `theme.json`: An empty file for your custom overrides.

#### Steps to Create a Custom Theme

1.  **Locate the Theme Files:**
    Navigate to the application's configuration directory:
    ```bash
    cd ~/.local/lutris-gamepad-ui/
    ```

2.  **Identify the Element to Style:**
    Open `theme.default.json` to find the CSS selector for the UI element you wish to change (e.g., `:root`, `.game-card`).

3.  **Add Your Overrides:**
    Open `theme.json` and add your custom styles, including only the selectors and properties you wish to modify.

4.  **Apply Changes:**
    Save the `theme.json` file. The application will detect the changes and apply your theme instantly, no restart required.

#### Example: Changing the Accent Color
To change the main accent color from red to blue:

1.  Find the `--accent-color` variable under the `:root` selector in `theme.default.json`.

2.  Add the following override to your `theme.json` file:
    ```json
    {
      ":root": {
        "--accent-color": "#0078d4"
      }
    }
    ```
3.  Save the file. The UI will immediately update with the new color.
