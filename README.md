# Lutris Gamepad UI

A simple, TV-friendly, gamepad-navigable frontend for the [Lutris](https://lutris.net/) game launcher on Linux.

## ü§î Why?

Lutris is a fantastic tool for managing games on Linux, but its default interface is designed for mouse and keyboard at a desk. This project aims to provide a "couch gaming" experience, similar to Steam's Big Picture Mode, allowing you to browse and launch your Lutris library entirely with a gamepad from the comfort of your sofa.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- A Linux-based operating system.
- [Lutris](https://lutris.net/downloads) installed and configured with your games.

## üöÄ Installation

You can download the latest `.AppImage` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/andrew-ld/lutris-gamepad-ui/releases).

After downloading, make the file executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x lutris-gamepad-ui-*.AppImage
./lutris-gamepad-ui-*.AppImage
```

### Arch User Repository (AUR)

Arch Linux users (and users of Arch-based distributions) can install [`lutris-gamepad-ui-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lutris-gamepad-ui-git) from the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository).
